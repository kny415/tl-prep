Exercises

Let's do some "ASCII Art" (a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens).

For this exercise, write a one-line program that creates 10 lines of the following:

The Flintstones Rock!
 The Flintstones Rock!
  The Flintstones Rock!
Solution
10.times { |index| puts (" " * index) + "The Flintstones Rock!"}


Create a hash that expresses the frequency with which each letter occurs in this string:

statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
ex:

{ "F"=>1, "R"=>1, "T"=>1, "c"=>1, "e"=>2, ... }
Solution
statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
c_hash = Hash.new
statement.each_char do |c|
  c_hash[c]  = statement.scan(/#{c}/).count
  end

The result of the following statement will be an error:

puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

Solution
typeerror conversion
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + #{40 + 2}

What happens when we modify an array while we are iterating over it?

What would be output by this code?
1
3

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers.each do |number|
  p "#{number}   #{numbers.inspect}"
  numbers.shift(1)
end
What would be output by this code?


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end
1
2

Solution


Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number:

def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  begin
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end until dividend == 0
  divisors
end
Alyssa noticed that this will fail if you call this with an input of 0 or a negative number and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you change the loop construct (instead of using begin/end/until) to make this work? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

Bonus 1

What is the purpose of the number % dividend == 0 ?

Bonus 2

What is the purpose of the second-to-last line in the method (the divisors before the method's end)?

Solution

while dividend > 0 do
  divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
  dividend -= 1
end

checks if result is an integer

returns divisors

Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. Elements are added to the rolling buffer and if the buffer becomes full, then new elements that are added will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations saying, "Take your pick. Do you like << or + for modifying the buffer?". Is there a difference between the two, other than what operator she chose to use to add an element to the buffer?

def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size >= max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size >= max_buffer_size
  buffer
end
Solution
rolling_buffer1 alters buffer
rolling_buffer2 does not alter input_array

Alyssa asked Ben to write up a basic implementation of a Fibonacci calculator, A user passes in two numbers, and the calculator will keep computing the sequence until some limit is reached.

Ben coded up this implementation but complained that as soon as he ran it, he got an error. Something about the limit variable. What's wrong with the code?

limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"
How would you fix this so that it works?

Solution
$limit = 15
and change < limit to < $limit

In another example we used some built-in string methods to change the case of a string. A notably missing method is something provided in Rails, but not in Ruby itself...titleize! This method in Ruby on Rails creates a string that has each word capitalized as it would be in a title.

Write your own version of the rails titleize!

Solution

def titleize (title)
  title.split.map { |word| word.downcase.capitalize }.join(' ')
end
titleize("the [quick] brown fox")


Given the munsters hash below

munsters = { 
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" }, 
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" }, 
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" }, 
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}
Modify the hash such that each member of the Munster family has an additional "age_group" key that has one of three values describing the age group the family member is in (kid, adult, or senior). Your solution should produce the hash below

{ "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Lily" => {"age" => 30, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "senior" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male", "age_group" => "kid" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female", "age_group" => "adult" } }
Note: a kid is in the age range 0 - 17, an adult is in the range 18 - 64 and a senior is aged 65+.

hint: try using a case statement along with Ruby Range objects in your solution

Solution

munsters.each do |name, traits|
case traits["age"]
  when 0..17
    traits["age_group"] = "kid"
  when 18..64
    traits["age_group"] = "adult"
  when proc { |n| n > 64 }
    traits["age_group"] = "senior"
  else
    traits["age_group"] = "idk"
  end
  end
