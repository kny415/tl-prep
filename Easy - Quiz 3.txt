Show an easier way to write this array:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]
Solution
flintstones = %word{Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, BamBam, Pebbles}

How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
Solution
flintstones.push("Dino")



In the previous exercise we added Dino to our array like this:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flintstones << "Dino"
We could have used either Array#concat or Array#push to add Dino to the family.

How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

Solution
flintstones.push("Dino").push("Hoppy")


Shorten this sentence:

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
...remove everything starting from "house".

Review the Array#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".

As a bonus, what happens if you use the Array#slice method instead?

Solution
advice.slice!(0, advice.index("house"))

Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:

statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"
Solution
statement.scan('t').count

Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?
